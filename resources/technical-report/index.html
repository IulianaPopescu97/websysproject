        </p>

        <br>
        <h3 id="Introduction" class="text-info">Introduction</h3>
        <p>
            While developing this web platform, we have taken into consideration various aspects, such as the user
            interaction and gameplay and also the overall design and look of the website, which we considered vital for
            it's charm and succes.
        </p>
        <p>
            As far as the design goes, we considerd that it would be the best fit for our webiste if we went for a
            uniform, simple and yet attracting interface that sported a selection of simple but eye-caching animations. 
            When it comes to the color pallet, we tried to make the most out of the color sported by Marvel's superheros.
            Our goal is to provide the players on the platfom with a colorfoul and memorable interface that would keep
            them interested in trying out all of it's futures and functionalities.
            The design at it's core is build around the "Superhero" craze that Marvel created.
        </p>
        <p>
            The user interaction is designed to be consistent, functional and also engaging. 
            The user is meant to feel familiar, in control, but also is encouraged to discover on his own. 
        </p>
        <hr>
        <br>
        <h3 id="Front-End-Technologies" class="text-info">Front End Technologies</h3>
        <p>
            In the development of the user interface, we decided on using the Angular Framework, as it is a very popular choice in designing 
            modern web application and it allows us to build single page application that look and feel up-to-date, reuse components and make good use of
            many already existing libraries and UI elements.  
        </p>
        <p>
            In our case, we used <code onclick="location.href='https://angular.io/'" style="cursor: pointer; color:red">Angular</code> version 10.1 for our angular server and <code onclick="location.href='https://nodejs.org/en/'" style="cursor: pointer; color: green">NodeJS</code> version 14.15.1 as our the package manger <code onclick="location.href='https://www.npmjs.com/'" style="cursor: pointer;">npm</code>, as it  facilitates an
            easy package install solution through it's package.json file. The versions we chose are the latest stable version and we chose them as they have <code style="color: grey"><b>LTS</b></code>(Long Term Support)
            and have been pached with the latest security and functionality fixes.
        </p>
        <p>
            In addition to this, we used a series of additional packages that helped acheve the level of functionality and modern look that we aimed for:
        </p> 
        <ul>
            <li>
                <span class="text-secondary"><code onclick="location.href='https://www.primefaces.org/primeng/'" style="cursor: pointer">PrimeNg</code></span>
                <p class="ml-4">This package contains a multitude of pre-made modern UI elements like: buttons, drop-down lists, tables, etc. which helps us create a page faster and with our desired look.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <span class="text-secondary"><code onclick="location.href='https://material.angular.io/'" style="cursor: pointer">Angular Material</code></span>
                <p class="ml-4">This package is very popular while developing with the Angular framework, as it suppliments the the native HTML UI elements and also the ones from missing from other packages like PrimeNg.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <span class="text-secondary"><code onclick="location.href='https://fontawesome.com/'" style="cursor: pointer">Font Awesome</code></span>
                <p class="ml-4">It includes a large collection of graphical elements that can be imported into our
                    project, rather than manually recreating them in css, making our work a lot easier and faster. In our project, it is mostly used in order to add suggestive and modern icons to UI elements.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <span class="text-secondary"><code onclick="location.href='https://rxjs-dev.firebaseapp.com/guide/overview'" style="cursor: pointer">RxJS</code></span>
                <p class="ml-4">RxJS is a library for composing asynchronous and event-based programs by using observable sequences. It provides one core type, the Observable, satellite types (Observer, Schedulers, Subjects) and operators inspired by Array#extras (map, filter, reduce, every, etc) to allow handling asynchronous events as collections.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <span class="text-secondary"><code onclick="location.href='https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/components/modal/'" style="cursor: pointer">Bootstrap</code></span>
                <p class="ml-4">Bootstrap allows us to use pre-made templates for CSS classes and also graphical control elements like a modal, navbar etc.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <hr>
        <br>
        <h3 id="Back-End-Technologies" class="text-info">Back End Technologies</h3>
        <p>For the Back End implementation, our plan is to use a Backend-as-a-Service platform that works with the REST API princile,
            in order to manage data to and from the client in the JSON format as to to facilitate a faster development.
            For this purpose we chose <code onclick="location.href='https://firebase.google.com/'" style="cursor: pointer; color: blue">FireBase</code> as our primary Back-End soution.
        </p>
        <p>FireBase is a compllex BaaS that will also handle our data persistance needs, as it would serve us as an API, Server and also data storage solution.</p>
        <hr>
        <br>
        <h3 id="api" class="text-info">API</h3>
        <p>
           The web service that we chose to integrate into our application is one for data in the JSON format, as well as images.
           The service that we use is called <code onclick="location.href='https://developer.marvel.com/'" style="cursor: pointer; color: blue">The Marvel Comics API</code>
           which offers a large database of information and images related to the Marvel comics.
        </p>
        <ul class="ml-4 text-secondary">
            <li>
                The Marvel Comics API is a RESTful service which provides methods for accessing specific resources at canonical URLs and for searching and filtering
                sets of resources by various criteria. All representations are encoded as JSON objects.
            </li>
            <li>
                It allows us to request specific data object or collections that we are interested in.
            </li>
            <li>
                For the requested image the API provides different query parameters that can be used to alter the images in various ways.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <hr><br>
        <h3 id="uiDesign" class="text-info">User interaction and design</h3>
        <p>The web application we propose consists of multiple components, as follows:</p>
        <br>
        <h5 id="authentication" class="text-info">Authentication</h5>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>
           For authentication we decided to make use of simple forms for both the registration and the login functionalities.
           This ensures that it would be easy to login as well as sign up for our service.
        </p>
        <p>
           We tried to keep the registration form as small and not-intrusive as possible, as to not endager any important personal imformation to a possible leak
           or risk that a user would leave our page due to the fear of providing us with it's important privare details.
           The required fields in our sign-up form are: username, email and password.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p> 
        <br>
        <h5 id="home-page" class="text-info">Home page</h5>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>
            The home page contains a list with the recommended games based on their rating that you can try out and play, a setting section where you can change
            you username or password and also the sign-out functionality. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Also, it contains a list of tips and tricks on how to play these games and achive the best results.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h5 id="games-page" class="text-info">Games page</h5>
        <p>
            On this page the logged-in users can enjoy playing the game of their choice and see their highscore.
        </p>
        <p>
            Functionalities such as game rating will also be available, as well as an option to rate and write a short reviews for the game they have played.
        </p>
        <h6>The page makes use the most out of the following technologies:</h6>
        <ul class="ml-4 text-secondary">
            <li>
                Marvel Comics API: for requesting data and images used in our mini-games.
            </li>
            <li>
                PrimeNg and AngularMaterial: for designing the layout of the page, grid model, etc.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <h5 id="hiscore-page" class="text-info">Highscore page</h5>
